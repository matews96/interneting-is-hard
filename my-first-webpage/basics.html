        <h1>Inteneting is Easy!</h1>
        <p>First, we need to learn som HTML</p>

        <h2>Headings</h2>
        <p>Headings determine the layout of our site. There are six levels of headings</p>

        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add a ul element</li>
            <li>Add each element with the tag li</li>
            <li>They don't have to be in any particular order</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is an ordered list:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Look how everything is sorrounded by an ol</li>
            <li>And the items are the same as the unordered list</li>
            <li>But they have number! they increment automatically</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Inline Elments</h2>
        <p><em>Sometimes</em> you need to draw attetion to a specific word</p>
        <p>Other times you need <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize a word</p>
        <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

        <h2>Self-closing elements</h2>
        <p>Thanks for reading, interneting should be becoming easier now</p>
        <p>Best regards,</br>
